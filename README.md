# HelpfulGui
 A Helpful GUI Plugin for Spigot

## Help Contribute
As with most of my plugins there is the main branch and the dev branch. Dev branch doesn't have all bugs fixed. Main Branch Hopefully should. If you contribute to the dev branch you will have to fix some of my bugs and your bugs. Plus some features may end up being removed. Main branch you don't deal with any of that stuff. Whilst features might be removed from main they will probably be replaced with better ones. On the dev branch I will just remove the features and not do anything about it.
